                      <h2> What is Java Servlet? </h2>
                        <p>Java objects that are intended to pay the role of server components in client server communications. It Handles client requests by generating responses to such requests. Java Servlet is also a part of Java EE specification. It is hosted in a servlet container that provides the environment in which the servlet runs, as well as controls the servlet lifecycle.</p>

                            <h4>Initialization</h4>
                            <p>init() method</p>
                            <p>invoked only once and is intended for any startup initialization code for the servlet</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <p>invoked for each client request</p>
                            <p>servlet performs whatever logic necessary in order to serve the request and generate a response. Multiple client requests are typically handled by a single, multi-threaded servlet instance; thus, care must be exercised to ensure that the code being run by the servlet is thread-safe.</p>

                            <p>destroy() method</p>
                            <p>invoked before the servlet instance is unloaded and is untended for any housekeeping code that the servlet may need to run.</p>

                        <p>HTTPservlet is hosted in a web container which is a component in a Java application server.The service() method call is routed to doXXX() call, depending on the HTTP request method, e.g., doGet(), doPost(), doHead(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc.</p>

                               <li>HttpServletResponse - Object representation of the HTTP response generated by the servlet and sent back to the requesting client. It is used to set information in the response message.</li>
